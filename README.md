# ResScraper

## Introduction
This repository contains the python script for automating result extraction from VTU website. It was developed for internal purposes for documenting the results of students of the department. Back in the day, no consolidated results were available on the university website, instead we had to manually fetch and record result of each student seperately. The script automates this task of result extraction and saves the data into an excel file.
